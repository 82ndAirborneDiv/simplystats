It's somewhat of pet peeve but I dislike violin plots because they look like Christmas ornaments.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=3}
knitr::include_graphics("http://fullhdwall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Beautiful-Christmas-Ornaments.jpg")
```

But there is a practical reason as well. To demonstrate I created a dataset called `dat` that contains an outcome `value` for from 25 different groups.

```{r, echo=FALSE,  message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
set.seed(2)
N <- 1000
p <- 20
dat <- matrix(rnorm(N*p, 0, 1.5), p, N) + rnorm(p, 25, 1)
rownames(dat) <- LETTERS[1:p]
z <- rbinom(p, 1, prob = c(0.7, 0.3))
dat[7,] <- z*rnorm(N, 27.5, 0.5) + (1-z)*rnorm(N, 24.5, 1)
dat <- gather(data.frame(t(dat), stringsAsFactors = FALSE), group, value)
```

One of the first steps I take when analyzing data is to look at the distribution of my data. If there are groups, I like to stratify and look at the distributions. Histograms and smooth density estimates are my favorite tools for visualizing distributions. I have 20 groups in this data so I would start by quickly looking at a random subset:  

```{r histograms, fig.height=2.5}
dat %>% filter(group %in% c("A","H","I","P")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color="black") +
  facet_grid(.~group)
```

This plot shows me that the data looks normally distributed. To see how the groups compare to each other, a first step is to look at boxplots with groups reordered by their median value.

```{r boxplots,fig.height=2.5}
dat %>% mutate(group = reorder(group, value, median)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(group, value)) + geom_boxplot()
```

If you look close enough you note that group G looks a bit different: larger variance. But by summarizing into only 5 numbers, the boxplot misses an important characteristic of the data. Violin points lets you see the distributions rather than these points

```{r violin,fig.height=2.5}
dat %>% mutate(group = reorder(group, value, median)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(group, value)) + geom_violin(fill = "blue")
```

Do you see it? If you look close enough group G appears to be bimodal. But why is it hard to see?

1. Adding a mirror image of the density to make them resemble boxplots in some manner makes them look like Christmas ornaments and is distracting.
2. We are used to looking at histograms and densities with the variable in the x-axis not the y-axis.

I much prefer to stack histograms or density estimators vertically. So I was happy to learn about the [ggjoy](https://github.com/clauswilke/ggjoy) package that let's you make a much more aesthetically pleasing version.
 The `ggjoy` packages let's you do this in one line:


```{r joy, fig.height=6}
library(ggjoy)
dat %>% mutate(group = reorder(group, value, median)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=value, y=group, height=..density..)) +
  geom_joy(scale=1, alpha=0.5)
``` 

Note how quickly we notice the bimodal plot.
